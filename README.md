# AG Grid in PCF

### Here, I have implemented the integration of AG-Grid in PCF. This project demonstrates the basics of achieving an Excel-like feature in our Power Canvas App.

### prerequisites-
* node js.
* Microsoft Power Platform CLI.
* VS Code as a text editor.
* dotnet build tools or dotnet sdk.
* API as a data source.

### Notes:
* I have used external API as a data source for the Ag-Grid.
* Anyone can fork or clone this repo and fine-tune the AgGrid.tsx file.
* can change the grouped column or pivot column.
